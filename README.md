Missile command game clone by Jeff Nix and Alex Spichak. Music by Aurient. This project requires [.NET SDK 5.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) and Visual Studio 2019 16.8.0 or later to compile. 

Controls:
- Aim with the mouse and press 1, 2, or 3 to launch a missile from the corresponding silo.
- Press Escape to pause the game.

Extra credit features:
- Custom InputBindings
- Custom Command for bindings
- Super fun dynamic LINQ shenanigans!
- Database is Entity Framework
- XAML event triggers
- Databinding used in some places
- Controller? What controller! Is MVVM baby
- Did you see that happen? No? Well not my fault you didn’t subscribe to the event!
- Buttery smooth animations
- Screen flash / shake effects
- Background music and sound effects
- Proper scaling on window resize
- Microtransaction-free

Shortcomings:
- Screen flash effect doesn’t extend to entire screen when window aspect ratio is not 16:9
- Enemy/player missile code needs refactoring
- Funny sounds on screen swap related to MediaPlayer
